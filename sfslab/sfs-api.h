/** This file defines the API exposed by sfs-disk.c.  Before you begin
    working on the assignment, you should read the doc comment above
    each function carefully.  You are implementing this specification;
    the doc comment for each function tells you what it is supposed to do.

    Do not change anything in this file while working on the assignment.
    If you do, Autolab will not see your modifications and your
    submission will probably not compile.  */

// TODO (lab devs only):
//   - Missing functionality: get file size (fstat), set file size (ftruncate)
//   - Consider making the "file descriptor" be a newtype, as best we can
//     in C (struct { int n; }) so it can't be confused with OS fds.  Might
//     be too annoying.

    You have to call this function in a loop, like this:

        char filename[SFS_FILE_NAME_SIZE_LIMIT];
        int status;

        }
        if (status < 0) {
          // error
        }

    You must set 'cookie' to NULL before the first call -- that's how
    sfs_list knows it's the first call.  sfs_list will store data in
    'cookie' to track its position within the directory.  When
    sfs_list eventually returns a nonzero 'status', it will also set
    'cookie' to NULL again.

    Once you start looping over file names, you must keep going until
    sfs_list returns a nonzero 'status'.  Failure to do this may cause
    deadlocks.  Deadlocks can also happen if you try to create,
    delete, or rename files from inside the loop.

    The return value is zero if and only if a file name was written to
    'filename_out'.  When the loop should stop -- when all the file
    names that there are have already been retrieved -- the return
    value is +1.  Finally, a negative error code is also possible,
    albeit only under unusual circumstances (e.g. calling sfs_list
    without having called sfs_mount first).  */
