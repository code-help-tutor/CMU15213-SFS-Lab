/** This file defines types and constants related to the "on-disk"
    data structures that is the SFS file system.  That is, everything
    in this file is connected somehow to the data actually stored in
    an SFS disk image.

    You should not need to change anything in this file, except
    *maybe* in order to solve some of the X traces.  If you do change
    something in this file, make sure to modify sfs-check.c to match,
    as well as sfs-disk.c. */

    called a "magic number" for the format.

    In case you're wondering, "\xB2\xB1\xB3" is "213" with the high
    bit of each byte set.  We did this because, if your file format
    cannot be reasonably interpreted as text, it's important to put
    some bytes that have their high bits set, but which do _not_ add
    up to a valid UTF-8 character, in its magic number.

    The trailing \x01 is a version number for the format.  If the
    format ever has to change in a way that makes old programs unable
    to read it, this number will be incremented.  */
